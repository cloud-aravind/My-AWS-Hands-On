Here I am launching an EC2 Instance in own VPC on AWS. And connecting to instance through SSH from windows local host using terminal.
Steps:
1.	Install AWS Cli v2 in local host (Windows 11).
2.	Login to your AWS account.
3.	Create your own VPC for instances.
4.	Launch two instances in public subnet.
5.	Set permissions for keypair.
6.	Connecting to first instance from local host using ssh from Windows terminal.
7.	Connecting to second instance from first instance using SSH.
8.	Host a “hello world” html web page in second instance.
